# Workplace Related Stress

### Project Overview

Over time, the social sciences, psychology, and medicine have all impacted how stress is conceptualized. Work-related stress is the physical, mental, and emotional strain when job demands exceed an employeeâ€™s ability to cope. It can result from excessive workload, tight deadlines, lack of control over tasks, workplace conflicts, or job insecurity.

This report will provide a Stress Level Report to help HR manage the stress source of the employees in the workplace.
